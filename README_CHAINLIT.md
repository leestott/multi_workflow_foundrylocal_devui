### 🔍 Research Agent  
- Expands on the plan with detailed research
- Validates feasibility and practical considerations
- Adds context, best practices, and expert insights

### 💡 Advisor Agent
- Synthesizes all findings into actionable recommendations
- Provides executive summary and key insights
- Delivers structured output with:
  - 🎯 Executive Summary
  - 📊 Key Findings & Analysis
  - 🔥 Priority Recommendations (immediate, short-term, long-term)
  - ⚠️ Risk Assessment & Mitigation
  - 📈 Success Metrics & Monitoring
  - 💡 Additional Considerations
